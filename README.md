# The Resume Project by Joost Schermers

## What have i done so far

1. Followed javascript basic course
2. Finished all assignments
3. Added d3 for some visualization + sample work.json.

## To Do
3. Review your work against the Project Rubric (on the next page).
4. When you are satisfied with your project, submit it according to the Submission Instructions on the next page.

## To start this project
You need to have a local webserver for the json file which d3 uses. (to overcome access denied). I recommend Xampp <https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html/>
